OPERATIONAL TIPS
1.
Safe operation
(1) After jacking up, always support with wooden blocks or rigid stands.
(2) When hoisting the vehicle or its heavy component, use wire rope(s) with a sufficient reserve in load
capacity.
(3) Always disconnect the battery plug before the inspection or servicing of electrical parts.
2.
Tactful operation
(1) Prepare the mechanic tools, necessary measuring instruments (circuit tester, megger, oil pressure
gauge, etc.) and SSTs before starting operation.
(2) Before disconnecting wiring, always check the cable color and wiring state.
(3) When overhauling functional parts, complicated portions or related mechanisms, arrange the parts
neatly to prevent confusion.
(4)
When disassembling and inspecting such a precision part as the control valve, use clean tools and
operate in a clean location.
(5) Follow the described procedures for disassembly, inspection and reassembly.
(6) Replace, gaskets, packing and O-rings with new ones each time they are disassembled.
(7) Use genuine Toyota parts for replacement.
(8) Use specified bolts and nuts. Observe the specified tightening torque at the time of reassembly.
(Tighten to the center of the specified tightening torque range.)
If
no tightening torque is specified, tighten the bolt or nut according to the standard tightening torque
table.
3.
Protection of functional parts
(1)
Thoroughly check each connector for any failure in or imperfect connection before reconnecting the
battery plug after the end of vehicle inspection or maintenance.
Failure in or imperfect connection of connectors related to controllers, especially, may
damage elements inside the controllers.
4.
Confirming defect status
Do not start immediate disassembly or replacement, but first confirm if such disassembly or replace-
ment is actually needed.
5.
Handling of waste fluid, etc.
When draining waste fluid from the vehicle, always receive it with an appropriate container.
Since careless or arbitrary discharge or disposal of oil, fuel, coolant, oil filter, battery or any other
harmful substance may cause adverse affect to people or environmental destruction, sort each waste
and always ask an authorized contractor for appropriate disposal.
6.
Handling of electronic parts
(1) Never apply impacts to electronic parts such as a mi-
crocomputer or relay.
(2) Never let electronic parts be exposed to a high tem-
perature or humidity.
(3) Do not touch connector pins since they may be de-
formed or be damaged due to static electricity.
0-6
JACK-UP POINT
Strictly observe the following instructions when jacking up the vehicle.
When a load is on the fork, unload it and park the vehicle on a flat floor. Be sure to avoid an inclined or
rugged place.
Use a jack with ample capacity and jack up the vehicle at the specified jack-up point. Jacking up at any
other point will be dangerous.
Never operate while the vehicle is held with a jack. Always support the frame with a wooden block
after jacking up.
In any case, never let a part of the body (including hands and feet) be under the jacked-up vehicle.

with a rear combination lamp, remove the lamp
ASSY.
CAUTION FOR TOWING
1.
When towing the forklift, always lift the rear wheels
away from the ground.
2.
The traveling speed in towing must not exceed the
maximum traveling speed of the forklift.
3.
Always set the key switch to OFF and the direction
switch to the neutral position before starting towing.
In case of towing by connection with a wire rope with
the operator on the forklift, however, set the key switch
to ON (PS operation) and always set the direction
switch to the neutral position.
4.
Before towing, either remove the fork or take an ac-
tion to prevent fork contact with the ground due to
bounding.

CIRCUIT TESTER
Circuit testers are available in both the analog and digital types. They should be used selectively according
to the purpose of measurement.
Analog type: This type is convenient for observing movement during operation, but the measured value
should only be used for reference or rough judgement.
Digital type:
Fairly accurate reading is possible, but it is difficult to observe the variation or movement.
1.
Difference in measurement results with the digital type and analog type
* The result may be different between measurements with the analog type and digital type.
Always use a circuit tester according to its operation manual.
Cautions when the polarities are different between the analog type and digital type are described
below.

2.
Difference in result of measurement with circuit tester
The circuit tester power supply voltage depends on the tester type. 1.5 V, 3.0 V or 6.0 V is used.
The resistance of a semiconductor such as a diode varies with the circuit tester power supply voltage.
The diode characteristics are shown in the figure below.

Difference in measurement result by measurement range (analog type)
In the analog type circuit tester, changing the measurement range switches over the internal circuit to
vary the circuit resistance. Even when the same diode is measured, the measurement result varies
with the measurement range.
Always use the range described in the repair manual for
measurement.

BOARD INSPECTION
When the cause of a trouble is judged to exist in the CPU board or the DC/MD board, connect SST
09240-23400-71 or 09230-13700-71 to the corresponding connector and measure the applied voltage
and resistance at each connector.
Always disconnect the battery plug before measuring the resistance.
Caution:
Always disconnect the battery plug before removing or installing the CPU board or the DC/MD
board.
Note:
When replacing the CPU or DC/MD board since it is judged as the cause of a trouble as the result
of troubleshooting, always measure the applied voltage and resistance of each related portion.
(1) SST setting method
1
Set the key switch to OFF and disconnect the battery plug.
2
Connect the SST to the corresponding connector pin.
Caution:
Carefully connect the SST to the correct connector pin by confirming the pin NO. since incorrect
connection may damage normal portions.

LED DISPLAY
GENERAL
The LED display has two main functions: battery charge indication and diagnostic display.
It acts as the battery charge indicator while the vehicle is operating normally. When an error occurs in the
vehicle electrical system, it is automatically switched to diagnostic display to warn the operator of an error
and make the controller automatically control traveling and material handling to ensure safety.
Battery Charge Indication and Alarm Functions
1.
The LED display appearance and the function of each LED are as illustrated.
2.
The battery charge is indicated by ON/OFF
Check lamp
of each LED as listed below.

indicator
3.
Upon key switch ON, all LEDs come on for
2 seconds to enable defective LED check.
If normal, the display indicates the remain-
ing battery charge. If any abnormality is
654321
found, the display indicates the diagnostic
result (which will be explained later).
4.
The number of lighting LEDs decreases as
the battery charge drops. When the dis-
charge level decreases to the set level (ini-
tial setting: approx. 80% of full capacity), the
discharge lamp on the display is lit to warn

When a traveling, material handling or PS
OFF
circuit defect or a sensor defect is found,
the check lamp is lit to warn the operator of
the abnormality. The lighting pattern of bat-
tery charge LEDs shows the defect position
(See the Diagnosis Code List).
Example of display of diagnosis
4
3.
The diagnostic display indicates all faulty positions detected by the controller repeatedly at intervals 3
seconds.
Example: The controller detected three errors simultaneously, A1, CO and C2
: ON
: OFF
"A1" output for 3 seconds
"CO" output for 3 seconds
"C2" output for 3 seconds
The error code output cycle repeats itself.
4.
The controller stores up to 10 errors detected up to the time. Connect the SST plug-in analyzer to call
and check the diagnosis error codes stored in the controller. For details, see the Plug-in Analyzer
section of this manual.
5.
When repair is completed according to the indicated diagnosis code, clear all of the stored diagnosis
codes using the SST plug-in analyzer.
This enables the operator to distinguish between old and new diagnosis codes.
6.
When an error code is indicated on the display, make a prompt repair by referring to the troubleshoot-
ing procedure for each indicated diagnosis code described later (Section 5) in this manual.

PLUG-IN ANALYZER (SST)
GENERAL
1.
For a standard vehicle with an LED display, use the SST plug-in analyzer to indicate the status of each
electrical system operation such as traveling, Material handling, EPS or acceleration, to read the
information on errors detected by the controller, and to perform tuning to set vehicle functions.
2.
The plug-in analyzer enables quick, easy servicing and vehicle tuning to match customer needs.
3.
The plug-in analyzer supports the operator in checking the control system and troubleshooting through
communication with the traveling/material handling controller.
4.
The plug-in analyzer functions for the electrical system are the same as those on the vehicle with the
LCD display (option).
Note:
The plug-in analyzer, however, cannot check SAS functions.

ANALYZER
GENERAL
1.
Switching the multi-display to the analyzer mode permits checks of traveling, material handling, EHPS
and SAS main circuits, operation systems such as the accelerator and sensor functions as well as
detection of problem components.
2.
Full utilization of the analyzer functions helps quick, easy servicing.
3.
The analyzer supports inspection of the control system and troubleshooting through full communica-
tion with the traveling/material handling controller.
4.
The analyzer has the following functions:
(1) Diagnosis memory function (DIAG MEMORY)
The controller stores up to 10 error codes (diagnosis codes) detected in the electrical system in the
past. The diagnosis function reads these error codes and indicates them on the display.
Each error code is displayed with its detection time as the key ON hour meter reading.
(2) In/out monitor function (I/O MONITOR)
This function displays the analog input values from individual sensors in the traveling, material
handling, EHPS and SAS systems. Monitoring the displayed values enables the quality of each
circuit/sensor to be judged.
1
I/O MONITOR1
Displays the temperature and analog input voltage at the respective terminal of each electrical
component detected by the controller.
2
I/O MONITOR2
Displays each switch ON/OFF state and analog input voltages from sensors for traveling and
swing control.
3
I/O MONITOR3
Displays the material handling and mast switch ON/OFF states and analog input voltages
from material handling and mast sensors.
4
I/O MONITOR4
Displays the ON/OFF states of knob position correction control and other switches and the
analog input voltages from respective sensors.
(3) Active test (ACTIVE TEST)
In the active test mode, the controller forcibly outputs an activate signal (ON or OFF signal) to the
selected item in order to permit operation check of that function.

MATCHING
GENERAL
For the tilt angle, load, tire angle and swing angle sensors among sensors used for SAS functions, the
signal voltage values under the mast vertical, no load, tire straight and rear axle horizontal conditions are
stored, respectively, in the controller for the control based on these values. When servicing or replacing
these sensors, matching (updating the sensor signal voltage to match the standard vehicle condition) is
necessary. Also, matching is needed for the tilt angle sensor when the vehicle posture has changed
excessively, and for the load sensor when the load under no load condition (no load on fork) is changed
because of addition or removal of any attachment.

Before Starting Matching
Set the vehicle to the standard vehicle condition before starting matching. The standard vehicle condition
means when the vehicle satisfies the conditions described below.
1.
Tire inflating pressure check
Adjust the tire inflating pressure to the specified
V.SV mast
FV-FSV mast
level.
If it is insufficient or if there is a difference between
the front and rear wheels or between LH and RH
wheels, Matching will become inaccurate.
2.
Floor levelness check
If matching is conducted on an inclined or rough
floor surface, errors in matching will result. So, per-
form matching on a flat, horizontal floor (inclina-
tion: Within 0.5°).
Generally the inclination of floors in ordinary plants,
500 mm (20 in)
warehouses and buildings is within 0.5°, which
does not influence matching adversely. Be care-
ful since some parts of floors may be inclined over
0.5° for some reason or other.
X
3.
No-load vertical condition check
The voltage of the load sensor signal in no-load
state is stored in the controller. Therefore, the fol-
lowing conditions must be satisfied:
For the V/SV mast, set the fork height to about
500 mm (20 in.) and use a goniometer to see
that the mast is vertical.
For the FV/FSV mast, set the rear cylinder rod
projection to about 100 mm (4 in.) and use a
goniometer to see that the mast is vertical.
For the vehicle with an attachment, install the
attachment.
Within 50 mm (2.0 in)
Set the mast vertical by operating tilting it in the
each on the left and
forward tilting direction from the backward tilted
right side
position.
On a vehicle with attachment (U61C671-1-2 or
an attachment whose weight exceeds that
shown in the table below), set the mast vertical
with the attachment at a height of 500 mm (19.7
in) and perform relief at the topmost position.
(See the table below showing the Allowable
Weight for Installation on Mast.
5 m (16.5 ft)
4.
Tire straight traveling condition check
The signal voltage of tire angle sensor is stored in
the controller when the tires are traveling straight.
So, fix the steering wheel and see that the leftward
or rightward deviation during traveling 5 meters
(16.5 ft.) is within 50 mm (2.0 in.).

SST4SST9 setting method
The traveling/material handling motor drive instruction signal is checked by reversal between the travel-
ing and material handling systems. The material handling lever operation for checking the traveling
circuit is not an error.
SST4 and SST9 are used for judging the quality of the instruction signal from the CPU board to the DC/
MD board and the drive signal from the DC/MD board to the MOS when any abnormality is found in the
check using SST3.
Pay special attention to the operation because SST4 and SST9 are set while SST3 is set. (Especially
pay attention to battery plug ON/OFF and motor cable disconnection.)

SST5 setting method
SST5 is used for judging the quality of the spring solenoid valve and steering angle correction solenoid
valve drive signals.
It is used to check whether the drive signal from the SCPU board in the PS controller or the drive signal
from the DC/SD board is defective.
(1) Disconnect the wiring between CN146 and CN147, and set SST5.
Always connect the connector connected with more number of cables to the SCPU board (CN146).
Since the number of pins and the shape are the same at both ends of SST5, carefully avoid wrong
connection.
(2) Check the ON state of each solenoid in the ANL.ACTIVE mode.
